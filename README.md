Hands-on System Programming with Linux, Kaiwan N Billimoria, published by Packt

This is the GitHub repository for the above book, published by Packt (2018).
The repo contains the following:

- ch'n': a directory for each chapter, named as ch'n' ; n=1, 2, 3, ..., 21.
  Each chapter directory will further contain:
   - the source code: Makefile, 'C' source and header files
   - a text file named in the format assignments\_ch'n' ; which of course
     will contain all prescribed assignments to the reader for this chapter.

- solutions\_to\_assgn : a directory, which will contain selected solutions to
  assignments prescribed in the book. The solutions are organized by chapter,
  each chapter (that requires this) will have a directory within which you
  can find selected solutions. The 'solutions' are mostly in the form of code
  (along with the associated Makefile, if required); on occasion, the
  assignment is a "question type" and the answer can be found in a text file
  named as ch'n'\_solutions.txt.
